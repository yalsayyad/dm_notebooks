    " * Agree on short term solution to RFC that fixes current problems.  "

    "## Current problems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tasks that are awkward/impossible\n",
    " 1. Can't make direct/psfMatched, deep/bestSeeing etc... coadds in one DRP (without --clobber-config!). In LDM-151 these are called DeepCoadd, BestSeeingCoadd and ConstantPsfCoadd. We may want different modelPsfs for different purposes (e.g. deblending, artifact rejection) too.\n",
    " 2. Implementing artifact rejection in deepCoadds. This requires a PSF-Matched Median coadd as an intermediate data product.\n",
    " 3. Can't generate series of `ShortPeriodCoadds` without mutliple output repos. \n",
    " 4. TemplateCoadds for Alert Production binned by parallactic angle or wavelength to account for DCR.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The proliferation of data types in obs-base smells bad. \n",
    "* The illusion of \"deep\" being configurable is a lie. It's hard codded the argument parser, for example. "

    " * `ObsCondition` (i.e. `deep`, `bestSeeing`) = data Id key\n",

    "Therefore, we propose to remove the \"deep\" specifier and specify the additional coadd keys in 1 or 2 new tasks that:\n",
    "* `RegisterCoaddsPsfMatchSizes`\n",

    "* In the same way that `patch` is a string that maps to a bounding box via the skymap, these tasks will define *string labels* for configs in a per-repo data product analgous to `skyMap.pickle`.\n",
