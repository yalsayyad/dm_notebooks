    "There are two types of duplicates in the source catalogs. \n",
    "1. *Deblender* parents vs. their children\n",

    "### Deblender:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to a group of blended objects as a “family.” A “child” refers to a particular deblended object within a family. A “parent” is also created for each family, representing the alternate hypothesis that the blend is actually a single object. For a blend, both the parent and children are entered into the catalog, with the parent having `detect_isPrimary = False`, and `deblend_nChild = <number of children it has>`. The children will have `detect_isPrimary = True`, `deblend_nChild = 0` and `parent = <id of the parent>`.  You can self join the on ID of the parent to filter out sources with exceptionally bright parents which have pathological photometry. You can also only select children by limiting to `deblend_nChild == 0`.\n",
